# Analysis üó£Ô∏è

Avid basketball fans watch today‚Äôs NBA games and relish the claim that, ‚ÄúThe game isn‚Äôt as good as it used to be,‚Äù or that, ‚ÄúTeams then were better than teams now.‚Äù For this project, I examined how teams‚Äô statistical profiles have evolved since 2000, highlighting trends in scoring, pace, and shot selection, and exploring what teams have chosen to prioritize as the years have gone on.

The objective of this analysis is to explore how team strategies have changed over time using both basic statistics and advanced metrics. The goal is to identify trends in shooting behavior, game pace, defensive performance, and overall team efficiency.

Data was collected from official NBA box scores and advanced statistics spanning the 2000 to 2025 seasons. The dataset includes both basic counting stats (e.g., field goals, assists, rebounds) and advanced metrics (e.g., pace, offensive/defensive ratings, plus-minus). Missing values for counting stats were filled with zeros, while percentages and advanced metrics were left as NaN to preserve historical accuracy.

Overall, the data suggests that NBA teams have increasingly emphasized pace, perimeter shooting, and offensive efficiency over the past two decades, while defensive strategies have evolved to counter high-volume three-point shooting. This evolution reflects a league-wide shift toward analytics-driven decision-making and an ever-greater focus on offensive optimization.
