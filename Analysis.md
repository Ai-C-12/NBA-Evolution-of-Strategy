# Analysis üó£Ô∏è

Avid basketball fans watch today‚Äôs NBA games and relish the claim that, ‚ÄúThe game isn‚Äôt as good as it used to be,‚Äù or that, ‚ÄúTeams then were better than teams now.‚Äù For this project, I examined how teams‚Äô statistical profiles have evolved since 2000, highlighting trends in scoring, pace, and shot selection, and exploring what teams have chosen to prioritize as the years have gone on.

The objective of this analysis is to explore how team strategies have changed over time using both basic statistics and advanced metrics. As a basketball fan myself, I‚Äôve included context within each analysis to explain any irregularities, inconsistencies, or anomalies. The goal is to identify trends in shooting behavior, game pace, defensive performance, and overall team efficiency.

Data was collected from official NBA box scores and advanced statistics spanning the 2000 to 2025 seasons. The dataset includes both basic counting stats (e.g., field goals, assists, rebounds) and advanced metrics (e.g., pace, offensive/defensive ratings, plus-minus). Missing values for counting stats were filled with zeros, while percentages and advanced metrics were left as NaN to preserve historical accuracy.

**Note:** During the 2011-12 season, there was a lockout due to a labor dispute and that year's regular season have been reduced to only 66 games rather than the normal 82 games. Plus a noticeable dip appears around 2020-21 season likely due to pandemic-related disruptions.

## Pace vs Possessions
<img width="1070" height="547" alt="Pace vs Possessions" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2070f74b-d2fd-4816-a194-5fad292c92b1" />
This graph compares the evolution of Pace(possessions per 48 minutes) and total Possessions from the 2000‚Äì01 season through 2024‚Äì25. The data highlights how the tempo of NBA games has gradually increased, particularly after 2013, reflecting broader stylistic shifts in team play.

After remaining relatively stable in the early 2000s, both pace and total possessions began rising sharply around the mid-2010s. This period corresponds to the league‚Äôs transition toward faster, more offense-oriented basketball, the rise of small-ball lineups, and the growing emphasis on three-point shooting.

Overall, the steady increase in pace and possessions over the past decade demonstrates the league‚Äôs prioritization of speed, spacing, and offensive efficiency ‚Äî core components of modern basketball strategy.


## Defensive Strategy

This graph shows a side by side of the leagues defensive rating and the league's total blocks and steals statistics each season. This data highlights the league's overall defense and what teams prioritized, adapting to offense-oriented strategies.

The steady increase in Defensive Rating indicates that teams have struggled with keeping up with the league's rapidly growing offensive game and pace. As offense prioritized more on 3-point shooting, defenses were forced to cover more ground.

Overall, the data shows that while individual statistics like blocks and steals have not changed too much throughout the years, the league's overall defense is struggling to keep up with the growing dominance in offensive game. 


## Rebounding Strategy

This graph shows a box chart comparison of the league's offensive and defensive rebounding percentage for every 5 years. This data highlights teams priority in defensive bigs to grab defensive boards in order to gain more offensive opportunities.

Since the 2012-13 season, Defensive Rebounding percentage shows an increase while Offensive rebounding has been decreasing. This reflects how the league shifts away from getting offensive boards to getting back on transition defense so as to prevent fast breaks rather than fighting for offensive boards for a second field goal attempt.

Overall, this represents how teams are prioritizing more on pace control and quickly going back on defense as it is more risky to grab offensive rebounds due to current offense being so spread out.


## Overall Scoring Efficiency
<img width="1074" height="547" alt="Scoring Efficiency" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d27ffc75-30a5-41a5-8151-89560e833c94" />
<img width="1074" height="528" alt="3-Point Efficiency" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e6485db-dfe9-4746-b4a0-d2fc39f883a2" />
These graphs represent the league's scoring efficiency. This data highlights the sharp increase in the league's overall offensive output and scoring efficiency, especially utilizing the 3-pointers. From the early 2000s to the mid-2010s, league-wide True Shooting(TS%) and Effective Field Goal(EFG%) percentages showed slow growth. However, starting around 2015‚Äì16, both metrics began a sharp upward trend, marking the start of a new offensive era in the NBA.

When viewed alongside the second chart, this point aligns almost perfectly with a surge in 3-point attempts. Between 2015 and 2025, teams have increased their 3-point volume by more than double, while maintaining or even improving 3-point Effective Field Goal percentage, which rose from around 49‚Äì50% to over 54%. This indicates that teams didn‚Äôt just shoot more threes, they became significantly better at making them. The rise of 3-point efficiency and overall scoring metrics(TS% and EFG%) suggests that the three-point shot has become the single greatest contributor to modern offensive efficiency.

Meanwhile, total field goal attempts also trended upward, but not as sharply, implying that teams achieved higher scoring outputs without drastically increasing shot volume, but rather by optimizing shot their selection(fewer midrange, more 3s and shots near the rim).


## Assists vs Isolation Baskets
<img width="1010" height="547" alt="Assists vs Iso" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a4aa397-0b36-430e-b5bf-fcae26105238" />
This graph represents the league's percentage in isolation baskets and assists baskets. This data highlights how the league's offensive game has shifted away from isolation offense to distributing the ball amongst teammates in order to get wide-open easy baskets.

From 2000‚Äì2009, isolation-heavy playstyles ‚Äî influenced by streetball culture ‚Äî dominated offenses before analytics-driven motion systems took over. From then on, the offense has shifted to passing the ball around so that it's easier to have wide-open field goals.

Overall, this represents the shift in style from an individual playstyle to a more team-oriented playstyle.

Over the past 25 years, the NBA has evolved from a midrange and isolation-heavy league into a data-driven style centered around pace, spacing, and efficiency. The modern game reflects the direct influence of analytics on coaching philosophy, prioritizing shot quality over volume, versatility over size, and transition opportunities over offensive rebounding. This transformation underscores how deeply statistical insights now shape strategic decisions at every level of basketball.
