# **🏀 NBA Evolution of Strategy (2000–2025)**

This project analyzes how NBA team strategies have evolved over the past two decades using data from the official [NBA Stats API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api).  
It highlights major shifts in **pace, rebounding, defense, shooting efficiency, assists vs isolation, and the rise of the 3-point shot**.
